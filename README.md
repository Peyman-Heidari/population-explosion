Summary

The Visualization: https://peyman-heidari.github.io/population-explosion/

Global human population growth amounts to around 75 million annually, or 1.1% per year. The global population has grown from 1 billion in 1800 to 7 billion in 2012. It is expected to keep growing, and estimates have put the total population at 8.4 billion by mid-2030, and 9.6 billion by mid-2050.

The visualization analyzes data on the historic, current and future estimates and projections with number of inhabitants for the world's largest urban areas from 1950-2050.  The data covers cities and other urban areas with more than 750,000 people. Data was retrieved from https://nordpil.com/resources/world-database-of-large-cities/ .

The visulaization and the data demonstrate that many cities have doubled or even tripled in a 100 years span, which is not great news.

Design

I have studied the population explosion before and I searched for this specific dataset. My idea was to depipct population and its density on the global map. Luckily, I found this dataset that had some historical data in combination with predictions and started exploring it. It is very natural to show population on a map, since humans live on earth in different locations (cities) and there is a natural relationship that the audience is accustomed to from the beginning. To convey a feeling of the rate of population growth, area is very powerful. In addition, animation is a great tool to show progress of time, since animation takes time to run and can represent the data very well.


Feedback

After coding and iterating on the design many times on my own, I came up with the Original version. I shared the visualization with some of my architect friends and I received the following feedback: 

- Instwad of the color blue, a more neutral color like gray might help more.

- The circles are too dark and area of overlap can not be seen. Therefore adding transparency would be great.

- Animating the visualization will go a long way in conveying the message.

- A header to inform the audience what they are loking at would be great.

_ I received many great suggestion during the review process. Suggestions were to add replay button, a short explanation, and a legend, which were all implemented.

I incorporated all the comments and was very impressed by how much it matteres.

Resources

- Data came from https://nordpil.com/resources/world-database-of-large-cities/

- To perform data cleaning and transformation, I used Python along with the pandas and numpy.
